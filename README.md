# Speed Tests

In this repository, we test the computational performance of various programming languages, leveraging the [Leibniz formula for Ï€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80) as our benchmark.

While our focus isn't on an achieving an exact calculation of Pi, these tests reveal insights into each language's efficiency and performance. They also offer a glimpse into how various languages handle floating-point numbers.

## Supported Languages

This repository supports benchmarking for the following programming languages:

|     |            |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | Rust       |
| 2   | C          |
| 3   | C++        |
| 4   | Javascript |
| 5   | Python     |

## Prerequisites

Ensure Docker is installed on your system before running the tests.

Refer to the installation documentation for the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Addition IInformation

For detailed usage instructions, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash run.sh
```
